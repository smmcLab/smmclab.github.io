"# Provision node script as a service via forever, allowing it to automatically start on boot, working across various Linux distros and OS https://github.com/zapty/forever-service"

"# Version 16.04 of ubuntu uses systemd and no longer upstart (used by forever-service). In order for the service to be installed correctly, you must install upstart-sysv:"
    "# sudo apt-get install upstart-sysv"
    "# sudo update-initramfs -u"
    "# sudo reboot"

"# Prerequisite: forever must be installed globally using #npm install -g forever"
"# Install #npm install -g forever-service"
"# Provision a service 'SMMCLab_Docs' with smmcApp.js script in current directory $ sudo forever-service install SMMCLab_Docs --script smmcApp.js"
"# $ sudo forever-service delete SMMCLab_Docs. This command will stop service if running, clean up all provisioned files and service"
"# $ sudo forever list. Get list of running services (Remember all forever command line options are available since we use forever internally)"
